        "Creating a schema for the BharatPe app involves understanding the key entities, attributes, and relationships that underpin its functionality. BharatPe is a fintech platform in India that offers digital payment solutions and financial services to merchants. Let's design a schema for BharatPe based on its core features:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Transaction Entity:**\n",

        "   - MerchantID (Foreign Key referencing Merchant Entity): The merchant involved in the transaction.\n",
        "   - CustomerName: The name of the customer making the payment.\n",
        "   - PaymentAmount: The amount of the transaction.\n",
        "   - PaymentDate: The date when the transaction occurred.\n",
        "   - PaymentStatus: Indicates whether the payment was successful or pending.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **BankAccount Entity:**\n",
        "   - AccountID (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each bank account.\n",
        "   - MerchantID (Foreign Key referencing Merchant Entity): The merchant associated with the bank account.\n",
        "   - AccountNumber: The bank account number.\n",
        "   - BankName: The name of the bank.\n",

        "\n",

        "   - QRCodeData: The data encoded within the QR code (e.g., payment information).\n",
        "   - ExpiryDate: The date when the QR code expires.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Relationships:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Merchants initiate Transactions: Each merchant can have multiple transactions associated with their account.\n",
        "- Merchants have BankAccounts: Each merchant can link multiple bank accounts for receiving payments.\n",
        "- Merchants generate QR Codes: Merchants can generate QR codes for customers to make payments.\n",
        "- Transactions are associated with Merchants: Each transaction is linked to the merchant receiving the payment.\n",
        "- Transactions can have QR Codes: Transactions may be associated with QR codes for payment processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rationale Behind the Design:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Merchant entity serves as the central point, representing the businesses using BharatPe.\n",
        "- The Transaction entity records all payment transactions, capturing details like payment amount, date, and status.\n",
        "- BankAccount entity allows merchants to link their bank accounts for seamless fund transfers.\n",
        "- QRCode entity enables merchants to generate QR codes, simplifying payment collection from customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The schema design for BharatPe incorporates key entities and relationships that mirror the platform's functionality, facilitating digital payments and financial services for merchants. This schema provides a foundation for organizing and managing data within BharatPe's ecosystem, contributing to its effectiveness in serving businesses and customers in the Indian market."
